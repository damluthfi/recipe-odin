    <p>Learn how to make grape juice the easy way! Homemade Concord grape juice is a delicious, antioxidant-rich beverage that has a deep purple color and unique robust, fruity sweet grape flavor.</p>
    <h1>ingredients</h1>
    <p>
      The juice is literally just grapes – no added sugar, color, or preservatives – straight off the vine, picked the same day. (Don’t be tempted to add sugar, you don’t need it when making Concord grape juice with vine-ripened grapes!)
      Homemade Concord grape juice is deliciously rich and very thick, with an almost syrupy consistency. In a word, amazing.

        <li>
          <p>Put the grapes in a heavy-bottomed, lidded 5-quart pot and mash them with a potato masher. Cover the pot, bring to a boil over medium heat, and then turn heat down slightly and simmer 10 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Turn the heat off and cool to room temperature (this will take a couple hours).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Strain the juice through a cheesecloth-lined sieve fitted over a bowl to catch the liquid. Gently wring the cheesecloth to extract as much liquid as possible (wear food-safe gloves if possible, as grape juice will stain your
            hands and take a few days to wear off. And yes, I’m speaking from experience, lol!).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Transfer the juice to glass bottles or jars, and store in the fridge for up to 1 week.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Shake before serving.</p>
        </li>
